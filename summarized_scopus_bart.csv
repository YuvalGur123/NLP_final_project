Methods: This study explored the potential of using natural language processing (NLP) to harmonise different mental health questionnaires by matching individual questions based on their semantic content. Using the Sentence-BERT model, we calculated the semantic similarity (cosine index) between 741 pairs of questions from five questionnaires. Drawing on data from a representative UK sample of adults (N = 2,058), we calculated a Spearman rank correlation for each of the same pairs of items, and then estimated the correlation between the cosine values and Spearman coefficients. We also used network analysis to explore the model’s ability to uncover structures within the data and metadata. Results: We found a moderate overall correlation (r =.48, p <.001) between the two indices. In a holdout sample, the cosine scores predicted the real-world correlations with a small degree of error (MAE = 0.05, MedAE = 0.04, RMSE = 0.064) suggesting the utility of NLP in identifying similar items for cross-study data pooling. Our NLP model could detect more complex patterns in our data, however it required manual rules to decide which edges to include in the network. Conclusions: This research shows that it is possible to quantify the semantic similarity between pairs of questionnaire items from their meta-data, and these similarity indices correlate with how participants would answer the same two items. This highlights the potential of NLP to facilitate cross-study data pooling in mental health research. Nevertheless, researchers are cautioned to verify the psychometric equivalence of matched items. © The Author(s) 2024.",Data pooling; Harmonisation; Meta-analysis; Retrospective data harmonisation,BioMed Central Ltd,"Study explored potential of using natural language processing (NLP) to harmonise different mental health questionnaires.

The development of natural language processing technology has made it possible to measure mental states and reactions through open-ended questions, rather than predefined numerical rating scales, which have traditionally been the dominant method in psychological research. This study presented three ambiguity-related situations and responses collected online from 591 participants in an open-ended format. After the analysis with bidirectional encoder representations from transformers, correlations were calculated using scores from the numerical evaluation by conventional questionnaire, and a significant moderate positive correlation was found. Therefore, this study found that attitudes toward ambiguity can be measured using an open-ended response method of reporting everyday life states. It is a novel methodology that can be expanded to other scales in psychology and can potentially be used in educational and clinical situations where participants can be asked to respond with minimal burden. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Nature Research,The development of natural language processing technology has made it possible to measure mental states and reactions through open-ended questions.

Such investors often use specific Social Media channels to share short-term investment decisions and strategies, resulting in partial collusion and planning of investment decisions. The impact of online communities on the stock prices of affected companies has been considerable in the short term. This paper has two objectives. Firstly, we chronologically model the discourse on the most prominent platforms. Secondly, we examine the potential for using collaboratively made investment decisions as a means to assist in the selection of potential investments. To understand the investment decision-making processes of small-scale investors, we analyze data from Social Media platforms like Reddit, Stocktwits and Seeking Alpha. Our methodology combines Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modelling. Sentiment Analysis is conducted using VADER and a fine-tuned BERT model. For Topic Modelling, we utilize LDA, NMF and the state-of-the-art BERTopic. We identify the topics and shapes of discussions over time and evaluate the potential for leveraging information of the decision-making process of investors for trading choices. We utilize Random Forest and Neural Network Models to show that latent information in discussions can be exploited for trend prediction of stocks affected by Social Network driven herd behavior. Our findings provide valuable insights into content and sentiment of discussions and are a vehicle to improve efficient trading decisions for stocks affected from short-term herd behavior. © The Author(s) 2024.",Meme stocks; NLP; Sentiment analysis; Topic modelling; Transformer models; Trend prediction,Springer,"The impact of online communities on the stock prices of affected companies has been considerable in the short term.

While numerous data analytics techniques have been proposed for ASD evaluation, the process remains time-consuming and lacks clarity. Eye tracking (ET) data has emerged as a valuable resource for ASD risk assessment, yet existing literature predominantly focuses on predictive methods rather than descriptive techniques that offer human-friendly insights. Interpretation of ET data and Bayley scales, a widely used assessment tool, is challenging for ASD assessment of children. It should be understood clearly to perform better analytic tasks on ASD screening. Therefore, this study addresses this gap by employing linguistic summarization techniques to generate easily understandable summaries from raw ET data and Bayley scales. By integrating ET data and Bayley scores, the study aims to improve the identification of children with ASD from typically developing children (TD). Notably, this research represents one of the pioneering efforts to linguistically summarize ET data alongside Bayley scales, presenting comparative results between children with ASD and TD. Through linguistic summarization, this study facilitates the creation of simple, natural language statements, offering a first and unique approach to enhance ASD screening and contribute to our understanding of neurodevelopmental disorders. © The Author(s) 2024.",Autism spectrum disorder; Bayley; Eye-tracking; Fuzzy logic; Linguistic summarization,Springer,Eye tracking (ET) data has emerged as a valuable resource for ASD risk assessment.

Pouch urinary tract fistulae are rare. We aimed to describe the presentation, diagnostic workup, and management of patients with pouch urinary at our center. Methods: Our prospectively maintained pouch registry was queried using diagnostic codes and natural language processing free-text searches to identify ileoanal pouch patients diagnosed with any pouch-urinary tract fistula from 1997 to 2022. Descriptive statistics and pouch survival using Kaplan–Meier curves are presented. Numbers represent frequency (proportion) or median (range). Results: Over 25 years, urinary fistulae were observed 27 pouch patients; of these, 16 of the index pouches were performed at our institution [rate 0.3% (16/5236)]. Overall median age was 42 (27–62) years, and 92.3% of the patients were male. Fistula locations included pouch-urethra in 13 patients (48.1%), pouch-bladder in 12 patients (44.4%), and anal-urethra in 2 (7.4%). The median time from pouch to fistula was 7.0 (0.3–38) years. Pouch excision and end ileostomy were performed in 12 patients (bladder fistula, n = 3; urethral fistula, n = 9), while redo ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) was performed in 5 patients (bladder fistula, n = 3; urethral fistula, n = 2). The 5-year overall pouch survival after fistula to the bladder was 58.3% vs. 33.3% with urethral fistulae (p = 0.25). Conclusion: Pouch-urinary tract fistulae are a rare, morbid, and difficult to treat complication of ileoanal pouch that requires a multidisciplinary, often staged, surgical approach. In the long term, pouches with bladder fistulae were more likely to be salvaged than pouches with urethral fistulae. © The Author(s) 2024.",Crohn’s disease; Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis; Ileoanal pouch; Ulcerative colitis; Urinary fistula,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,"Pouch urinary tract fistulae are rare.

Currently, investigations into the CO2 emissions of AI models remain an emerging area of research, and as such, we evaluate the CO2 emissions of well-known large language models, which have an especially high carbon footprint due to their significant amount of model parameters. We argue for the training of LLMs in a way that is responsible and sustainable by suggesting measures for reducing carbon emissions. Furthermore, we discuss how the choice of hardware affects CO2 emissions by contrasting the CO2 emissions during model training for two widely used GPUs.

However, the creation of such systematic reviews by clinical experts is costly as well as time-consuming, and results can get quickly outdated after publication. Most RCTs are structured based on the Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes (PICO) framework and there exist many approaches which aim to extract PICO elements automatically. The automatic extraction of PICO information from RCTs has the potential to significantly speed up the creation process of systematic reviews and this way also benefit the field of evidence-based medicine. Results: Previous work has addressed the extraction of PICO elements as the task of identifying relevant text spans or sentences, but without populating a structured representation of a trial. In contrast, in this work, we treat PICO elements as structured templates with slots to do justice to the complex nature of the information they represent. We present two different approaches to extract this structured information from the abstracts of RCTs. The first approach is an extractive approach based on our previous work that is extended to capture full document representations as well as by a clustering step to infer the number of instances of each template type. The second approach is a generative approach based on a seq2seq model that encodes the abstract describing the RCT and uses a decoder to infer a structured representation of a trial including its arms, treatments, endpoints and outcomes. Both approaches are evaluated with different base models on a manually annotated dataset consisting of RCT abstracts on an existing dataset comprising 211 annotated clinical trial abstracts for Type 2 Diabetes and Glaucoma. For both diseases, the extractive approach (with flan-t5-base) reached the best F1 score, i.e. 0.547 (±0.006) for type 2 diabetes and 0.636 (±0.006) for glaucoma. Generally, the F1 scores were higher for glaucoma than for type 2 diabetes and the standard deviation was higher for the generative approach. Conclusion: In our experiments, both approaches show promising performance extracting structured PICO information from RCTs, especially considering that most related work focuses on the far easier task of predicting less structured objects. In our experimental results, the extractive approach performs best in both cases, although the lead is greater for glaucoma than for type 2 diabetes. For future work, it remains to be investigated how the base model size affects the performance of both approaches in comparison. Although the extractive approach currently leaves more room for direct improvements, the generative approach might benefit from larger models. © The Author(s) 2024.",Clinical Trials; Deep Learning; Evidence-Based Medicine; Information Extraction; PICO,BioMed Central Ltd,"Systematic reviews of Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are an important part of the evidence-based medicine paradigm.

However, despite the resulting availability of large text corpora, little work has investigated Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications within this setting. Therefore, this preregistered approach (OSF: XA4PN) utilizes a sample of approximately 19,000 children and young adults that received a chat consultation from a 24/7 crisis service in Germany. Around 800,000 messages were used to predict whether chatters would contact the service again, as this would allow the provision of or redirection to additional treatment. We trained an XGBoost Classifier on the words of the anonymized conversations, using repeated cross-validation and bayesian optimization for hyperparameter search. The best model was able to achieve an AUROC score of 0.68 (p < 0.01) on the previously unseen 3942 newest consultations. A shapely-based explainability approach revealed that words indicating younger age or female gender and terms related to self-harm and suicidal thoughts were associated with a higher chance of recontacting.

Large language models (LLMs) are an emerging technology with promising capabilities for the automation of language-related tasks that may be useful for such a purpose. Methods: LLMs were used as part of an automated system to evaluate the relevance of publications to a certain topic based on defined criteria and based on the title and abstract of each publication. A Python script was created to generate structured prompts consisting of text strings for instruction, title, abstract, and relevant criteria to be provided to an LLM. The relevance of a publication was evaluated by the LLM on a Likert scale (low relevance to high relevance). By specifying a threshold, different classifiers for inclusion/exclusion of publications could then be defined. The approach was used with four different openly available LLMs on ten published data sets of biomedical literature reviews and on a newly human-created data set for a hypothetical new systematic literature review. Results: The performance of the classifiers varied depending on the LLM being used and on the data set analyzed. Regarding sensitivity/specificity, the classifiers yielded 94.48%/31.78% for the FlanT5 model, 97.58%/19.12% for the OpenHermes-NeuralChat model, 81.93%/75.19% for the Mixtral model and 97.58%/38.34% for the Platypus 2 model on the ten published data sets. The same classifiers yielded 100% sensitivity at a specificity of 12.58%, 4.54%, 62.47%, and 24.74% on the newly created data set. Changing the standard settings of the approach (minor adaption of instruction prompt and/or changing the range of the Likert scale from 1–5 to 1–10) had a considerable impact on the performance. Conclusions: LLMs can be used to evaluate the relevance of scientific publications to a certain review topic and classifiers based on such an approach show some promising results. To date, little is known about how well such systems would perform if used prospectively when conducting systematic literature reviews and what further implications this might have. However, it is likely that in the future researchers will increasingly use LLMs for evaluating and classifying scientific publications. © The Author(s) 2024.",Biomedicine; Large language models; Natural language processing; Systematic literature review; Title and abstract screening,BioMed Central Ltd,Large language models (LLMs) are an emerging technology with promising capabilities for the automation of language-related tasks that may be useful for such a purpose.

This study focuses on total hip, knee, and shoulder arthroplasty procedures as they account for most joint replacement surgeries. Apart from being a burden to healthcare systems, readmissions are also troublesome for patients. There are several studies which only utilized structured data from Electronic Health Records (EHR) without considering any gender and payor bias adjustments. Methods: For this study, dataset of 38,581 total knee, hip, and shoulder replacement surgeries performed from 2015 to 2021 at Novant Health was gathered. This data was used to train a random forest machine learning model to predict the combined endpoint of emergency department (ED) visit or unplanned readmissions within 30 days of discharge or discharge to Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) following the surgery. 98 features of laboratory results, diagnoses, vitals, medications, and utilization history were extracted. A natural language processing (NLP) model finetuned from Clinical BERT was used to generate an NLP risk score feature for each patient based on their clinical notes. To address societal biases, a feature bias analysis was performed in conjunction with propensity score matching. A threshold optimization algorithm from the Fairlearn toolkit was used to mitigate gender and payor biases to promote fairness in predictions. Results: The model achieved an Area Under the Receiver Operating characteristic Curve (AUROC) of 0.738 (95% confidence interval, 0.724 to 0.754) and an Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) of 0.406 (95% confidence interval, 0.384 to 0.433). Considering an outcome prevalence of 16%, these metrics indicate the model’s ability to accurately discriminate between readmission and non-readmission cases within the context of total arthroplasty surgeries while adjusting patient scores in the model to mitigate bias based on patient gender and payor. Conclusion: This work culminated in a model that identifies the most predictive and protective features associated with the combined endpoint. This model serves as a tool to empower healthcare providers to proactively intervene based on these influential factors without introducing bias towards protected patient classes, effectively mitigating the risk of negative outcomes and ultimately improving quality of care regardless of socioeconomic factors. © The Author(s) 2024.",Classification; Fairlearn; Natural language processing; Orthopedic; Predictive model,BioMed Central Ltd,"Study focuses on total hip, knee, and shoulder arthroplasty procedures as they account for most joint replacement surgeries.

Identifying changes in critically ill COVID-19 patients’ proteomes enables a better understanding of markers associated with susceptibility, symptoms, and treatment. We performed plasma antibody microarray and machine learning analyses to identify novel proteins of COVID-19. Methods: A case-control study comparing the concentration of 2000 plasma proteins in age- and sex-matched COVID-19 inpatients, non-COVID-19 sepsis controls, and healthy control subjects. Machine learning was used to identify a unique proteome signature in COVID-19 patients. Protein expression was correlated with clinically relevant variables and analyzed for temporal changes over hospitalization days 1, 3, 7, and 10. Expert-curated protein expression information was analyzed with Natural language processing (NLP) to determine organ- and cell-specific expression. Results: Machine learning identified a 28-protein model that accurately differentiated COVID-19 patients from ICU non-COVID-19 patients (accuracy = 0.89, AUC = 1.00, F1 = 0.89) and healthy controls (accuracy = 0.89, AUC = 1.00, F1 = 0.88). An optimal nine-protein model (PF4V1, NUCB1, CrkL, SerpinD1, Fen1, GATA-4, ProSAAS, PARK7, and NET1) maintained high classification ability. Specific proteins correlated with hemoglobin, coagulation factors, hypertension, and high-flow nasal cannula intervention (P < 0.01). Time-course analysis of the 28 leading proteins demonstrated no significant temporal changes within the COVID-19 cohort. NLP analysis identified multi-system expression of the key proteins, with the digestive and nervous systems being the leading systems. Conclusions: The plasma proteome of critically ill COVID-19 patients was distinguishable from that of non-COVID-19 sepsis controls and healthy control subjects. The leading 28 proteins and their subset of 9 proteins yielded accurate classification models and are expressed in multiple organ systems.

We subsequently built dictionaries from 100,000 clinical notes and analyzed 5.67 million clinical notes from 38,807 PTSD patients from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Subsequently, we showcased the significance of our approach by extracting and visualizing RDoC information in two use cases: (i) across multiple patient populations and (ii) throughout various disease trajectories. Results: The sentence transformer model demonstrated high F1 macro scores across all RDoC domains, achieving the highest performance with a cosine similarity threshold value of 0.3. This ensured an F1 score of at least 80% across all RDoC domains. The study revealed consistent reductions in all six RDoC domains among PTSD patients after psychotherapy. We found that 60.6% of PTSD women have at least one abnormal instance of the six RDoC domains as compared to PTSD men (51.3%), with 45.1% of PTSD women with higher levels of sensorimotor disturbances compared to men (41.3%). We also found that 57.3% of PTSD patients have at least one abnormal instance of the six RDoC domains based on our records. Also, veterans had the higher abnormalities of negative and positive valence systems (60% and 51.9% of veterans respectively) compared to non-veterans (59.1% and 49.2% respectively). The domains following first diagnoses of PTSD were associated with heightened cue reactivity to trauma, suicide, alcohol, and substance consumption. Conclusions: The findings provide initial insights into RDoC functioning in different populations and disease trajectories. Natural language processing proves valuable for capturing real-time, context dependent RDoC instances from extensive clinical notes. © The Author(s) 2024.",Clinical notes; Natural language processing; Post-traumatic stress disorder; Real-world evidence; Research of domain criteria,BioMed Central Ltd,Study: Extracting research of domain criteria (RDoC) from high-risk populations like those with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Findings provide initial insights into RDoC functioning in different populations and disease trajectories.

This study evaluates GPT-4's proficiency in responding to open-ended questions spanning diverse topics and cognitive complexities in comparison to human responses. To facilitate this assessment, we generated a dataset of 738 open-ended questions across Biology, Earth Sciences, and Physics and systematically categorized it based on Bloom's Taxonomy. Each question included eight human-generated responses and two from GPT-4. The outcomes indicate GPT-4's superior performance over humans, encompassing both native and non-native speakers, irrespective of gender. Nevertheless, this advantage was not sustained in ’remembering’ or ’creating’ questions aligned with Bloom's Taxonomy. These results highlight GPT-4's potential for underpinning advanced question-answering systems, its promising role in supporting non-native speakers, and its capacity to augment teacher assistance in assessments.

Recently, graph neural network (GNN) has made great progress in natural language processing (NLP) because of its powerful feature capture ability, but there are still two problems with the current method. On the one hand, the graph structure constructed for implicit sentiment text is relatively single, without comprehensively considering the information of the text, and it is more difficult to understand the semantics. On the other hand, the constructed initial static graph structure is more dependent on human labor and domain expertise, and the introduced errors cannot be corrected. To solve these problems, we introduce a dynamic graph structure framework (SIF) based on the complementarity of semantic and structural information. Specifically, for the first problem, SIF integrates the semantic and structural information of the text, and constructs two graph structures, structural information graph and semantic information graph, respectively, based on specialized knowledge, which complements the information between the two graph structures, provides rich semantic features for the downstream identification task, and helps to understanding of the contextual information between implicit sentiment semantics. To deal with the second issue, SIF dynamically learns the initial static graph structure to eliminate the noise information in the graph structure, preventing noise accumulation that affects the performance of the downstream identification task. We compare SIF with mainstream natural language processing methods in three publicly available datasets, all of which outperform the benchmark model. The accuracy on the Puns of day dataset, SemEval-2021 task 7 dataset, and Reddit dataset reaches 95.73%, 85.37%, and 65.36%, respectively.

In the era of machine learning and deep learning, these chaotic situations can be effectively controlled by developing efficient methods and models that can assist in classifying real and fake tweets. In this research article, an efficient method named BERT Embedding based CNN model with RMSProp Optimizer is proposed to effectively classify the tweets related disastrous scenario. Tweet classification is carried out via some of the popular the machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression and decision tree classifiers. Noting the low accuracy of machine learning models, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based deep learning model is selected as the primary classification method. CNNs performance is improved via optimization of the parameters with gradient based optimizers. To further elevate accuracy and to capture contextual semantics from the text data, BERT embeddings are included in the proposed model. The performance of proposed method - BERT Embedding based CNN model with RMSProp Optimizer achieved an F1 score of 0.80 and an Accuracy of 0.83. The methodology presented in this research article is comprised of the following key contributions: • Identification of suitable text classification model that can effectively capture complex patterns when dealing with large vocabularies or nuanced language structures in disaster management scenarios. • The method explores the gradient based optimization techniques such as Adam Optimizer, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Optimizer, AdaGrad, and RMSprop Optimizer to identify the most appropriate optimizer that meets the characteristics of the dataset and the CNN model architecture. • “BERT Embedding based CNN model with RMSProp Optimizer” – a method to classify the disaster tweets and capture semantic representations by leveraging BERT embeddings with appropriate feature selection is presented and models are validated with appropriate comparative analysis. © 2024","CNN; Deep Learning, BERT; Disaster tweets; Natural language processing; Tweet classification",Elsevier B.V.,"Event of the disastrous scenarios are actively discussed on microblogging platforms like Twitter which can lead to chaotic situations.

Early detection of pre-cancerous lesions is crucial for successful treatment and reducing mortality rates. However, traditional screening and diagnostic processes require cytopathology doctors to manually interpret a huge number of cells, which is time-consuming, costly, and prone to human experiences. In this paper, we propose a Multi-scale Window Transformer (MWT) for cervical cytopathology image recognition. We design multi-scale window multi-head self-attention (MW-MSA) to simultaneously integrate cell features of different scales. Small window self-attention is used to extract local cell detail features, and large window self-attention aims to integrate features from smaller-scale window attention to achieve window-to-window information interaction. Our design enables long-range feature integration but avoids whole image self-attention (SA) in ViT or twice local window SA in Swin Transformer. We find convolutional feed-forward networks (CFFN) are more efficient than original MLP-based FFN for representing cytopathology images. Our overall model adopts a pyramid architecture. We establish two multi-center cervical cell classification datasets of two-category 192,123 images and four-category 174,138 images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MWT outperforms state-of-the-art general classification networks and specialized classifiers for cytopathology images in the internal and external test sets. The results on large-scale datasets prove the effectiveness and generalization of our proposed model.

Natural language processing (NLP) could assist in coding free-text diagnoses, but NLP models require local training data to unlock their potential. The aim of this study was to develop a framework of research-relevant diagnostic codes, to test the framework using free-text diagnoses from a Swiss primary care database and to generate training data for NLP modelling. Methods: The framework of diagnostic codes was developed based on input from local stakeholders and consideration of epidemiological data. After pre-testing, the framework contained 105 diagnostic codes, which were then applied by two raters who independently coded randomly drawn lines of free text (LoFT) from diagnosis lists extracted from the electronic medical records of 3000 patients of 27 general practitioners. Coding frequency and mean occurrence rates (n and %) and inter-rater reliability (IRR) of coding were calculated using Cohen’s kappa (Κ). Results: The sample consisted of 26,980 LoFT and in 56.3% no code could be assigned because it was not a specific diagnosis. The most common diagnostic codes were, ‘dorsopathies’ (3.9%, a code covering all types of back problems, including non-specific lower back pain, scoliosis, and others) and ‘other diseases of the circulatory system’ (3.1%). Raters were in almost perfect agreement (Κ ≥ 0.81) for 69 of the 105 diagnostic codes, and 28 codes showed a substantial agreement (K between 0.61 and 0.80). Both high coding frequency and almost perfect agreement were found in 37 codes, including codes that are particularly difficult to identify from components of the electronic medical record, such as musculoskeletal conditions, cancer or tobacco use. Conclusion: The coding framework was characterised by a subset of very frequent and highly reliable diagnostic codes, which will be the most valuable targets for training NLP models for automated disease classification based on free-text diagnoses from Swiss general practice. © The Author(s) 2024.",Diagnostic coding; Electronic medical records; General practitioners; Reliability; Training data,BioMed Central Ltd,Natural language processing (NLP) could assist in coding free-text diagnoses.

However, selecting the appropriate emoji that matches a particular sentiment or emotion in the code-mixed text can be difficult. This paper presents a novel task of predicting multiple emojis in English-Hindi code-mixed sentences and proposes a new dataset called SENTIMOJI, which extends the SemEval 2020 Task 9 SentiMix dataset. Our approach is based on exploiting the relationship between emotion, sentiment, and emojis to build an end-to-end framework. We replace the self-attention sublayers in the transformer encoder with simple linear transformations and use the RMS-layer norm instead of the normal layer norm. Moreover, we employ Gated Linear Unit and Fully Connected layers to predict emojis and identify the emotion and sentiment of a tweet. Our experimental results on the SENTIMOJI dataset demonstrate that the proposed multi-task framework outperforms the single-task framework.

This technique should not cause damage to arteries, nerves, or shoulder joint components. Self-reduction is straightforward and can be done in clinics, making it ideal for people who suffer from shoulder joint dislocation frequently. The goal of this study is to compare the effectiveness of supervised self-reduction procedures vs. physician-assisted treatments in the treatment of anterior shoulder dislocations. Method: We conducted a comprehensive search on PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane up to March 22, 2023, using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist. Relevant articles were reviewed, with a focus on studies comparing supervised self-reduction techniques to physician-assisted techniques in cases of anterior shoulder dislocation. Results: Four papers in all were included in the meta-analysis. One prospective trial, one case-control study, one randomized clinical trial, and one retrospective trial made up these studies. The studies involved 283 patients in the physician-assisted group and 180 patients in the supervised self-reduction group. They were carried out in four European countries: Italy, Germany, Portugal, and Spain. The success rate of supervised self-reduction techniques was significantly higher, with an odds ratio of 2.71 (95% CI 1.25–5.58, p-value = 0.01). Based on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score, the physician-assisted group reported significantly higher maximum pain, with a mean difference of 1.98 (95% CI 1.24–2.72, p-value < 0.01). The self-reduction approaches exhibit shorter reduction time in comparison to physician-assisted groups. In addition, the self-reduction groups do not document any complications. Based on the GRADE system, the level of assurance in the evidence was high. Conclusion: Supervised self-reduction techniques outperform in terms of success rate and reduction-related maximum pain. These techniques could be used as an effective first-line treatment for anterior shoulder dislocation, potentially reducing the need for analgesics and emergency room visits. © The Author(s) 2024.",Efficacy; Pain; Reduction; Shoulder dislocation; Success rate,BioMed Central Ltd,"Supervised self-reduction techniques outperform in terms of success rate and reduction-related maximum pain.

SRs are costly and require the scarce resource of highly skilled reviewers. Automation technology has been proposed to save workload and expedite the SR workflow. We aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of SR automation studies indexed in PubMed, focusing on the applicability of these technologies in real world practice. Methods: In November 2022, we extracted, combined, and ran an integrated PubMed search for SRs on SR automation. Full-text English peer-reviewed articles were included if they reported studies on SR automation methods (SSAM), or automated SRs (ASR). Bibliographic analyses and knowledge-discovery studies were excluded. Record screening was performed by single reviewers, and the selection of full text papers was performed in duplicate. We summarized the publication details, automated review stages, automation goals, applied tools, data sources, methods, results, and Google Scholar citations of SR automation studies. Results: From 5321 records screened by title and abstract, we included 123 full text articles, of which 108 were SSAM and 15 ASR. Automation was applied for search (19/123, 15.4%), record screening (89/123, 72.4%), full-text selection (6/123, 4.9%), data extraction (13/123, 10.6%), risk of bias assessment (9/123, 7.3%), evidence synthesis (2/123, 1.6%), assessment of evidence quality (2/123, 1.6%), and reporting (2/123, 1.6%). Multiple SR stages were automated by 11 (8.9%) studies. The performance of automated record screening varied largely across SR topics. In published ASR, we found examples of automated search, record screening, full-text selection, and data extraction. In some ASRs, automation fully complemented manual reviews to increase sensitivity rather than to save workload. Reporting of automation details was often incomplete in ASRs. Conclusions: Automation techniques are being developed for all SR stages, but with limited real-world adoption. Most SR automation tools target single SR stages, with modest time savings for the entire SR process and varying sensitivity and specificity across studies. Therefore, the real-world benefits of SR automation remain uncertain. Standardizing the terminology, reporting, and metrics of study reports could enhance the adoption of SR automation techniques in real-world practice. © The Author(s) 2024.",Artificial intelligence; Automation; Evidence synthesis; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Systematic literature review; Text mining,BioMed Central Ltd,"The demand for high-quality systematic literature reviews (SRs) for evidence-based medical decision-making is growing.

Recently, artificial neural networks based on the Transformer architecture have revolutionized the field of natural language processing. Transformers integrate contextual information across words via structured circuit computations. Prior work has focused on the internal representations (“embeddings”) generated by these circuits. In this paper, we instead analyze the circuit computations directly: we deconstruct these computations into the functionally-specialized “transformations” that integrate contextual information across words. Using functional MRI data acquired while participants listened to naturalistic stories, we first verify that the transformations account for considerable variance in brain activity across the cortical language network. We then demonstrate that the emergent computations performed by individual, functionally-specialized “attention heads” differentially predict brain activity in specific cortical regions. These heads fall along gradients corresponding to different layers and context lengths in a low-dimensional cortical space. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Nature Research,"Transformations integrate contextual information across words via structured circuit computations.

To avoid the over generation often associated with this approach, we explore an alternative method based on word evolution. Word evolution examines the changing contexts of a word to identify changes in its meaning or associations. We investigate the possibility of using changing word contexts to detect drugs suitable for repurposing. Results: Word embeddings, which represent a word’s context, are constructed from chronologically ordered publications in MEDLINE at bi-monthly intervals, yielding a time series of word embeddings for each word. Focusing on clinical drugs only, any drugs repurposed in the final time segment of the time series are annotated as positive examples. The decision regarding the drug’s repurposing is based either on the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), or semantic triples extracted using SemRep from MEDLINE. Conclusions: The annotated data allows deep learning classification, with a 5-fold cross validation, to be performed and multiple architectures to be explored. Performance of 65% using UMLS labels, and 81% using SemRep labels is attained, indicating the technique’s suitability for the detection of candidate drugs for repurposing. The investigation also shows that different architectures are linked to the quantities of training data available and therefore that different models should be trained for every annotation approach. © The Author(s) 2024.",Deep learning; Drug repurposing; Literature based discovery; Word embeddings; Word evolution,BioMed Central Ltd,Word evolution examines the changing contexts of a word to identify changes in its meaning or associations.

Distinguishing MIS-C from SARS-CoV-2 negative sepsis (SCNS) patients is important to quickly institute the correct therapies. We performed targeted proteomics and machine learning analysis to identify novel plasma proteins of MIS-C for early disease recognition. Methods: A case-control study comparing the expression of 2,870 unique blood proteins in MIS-C versus SCNS patients, measured using proximity extension assays. The 2,870 proteins were reduced in number with either feature selection alone or with a prior COMBAT-Seq batch effect adjustment. The leading proteins were correlated with demographic and clinical variables. Organ system and cell type expression patterns were analyzed with Natural Language Processing (NLP). Results: The cohorts were well-balanced for age and sex. Of the 2,870 unique blood proteins, 58 proteins were identified with feature selection (FDR-adjusted P < 0.005, P < 0.0001; accuracy = 0.96, AUC = 1.00, F1 = 0.95), and 15 proteins were identified with a COMBAT-Seq batch effect adjusted feature selection (FDR-adjusted P < 0.05, P < 0.0001; accuracy = 0.92, AUC = 1.00, F1 = 0.89). All of the latter 15 proteins were present in the former 58-protein model. Several proteins were correlated with illness severity scores, length of stay, and interventions (LTA4H, PTN, PPBP, and EGF; P < 0.001).

This paper presents an overview of HTR using a gated mechanism and highlights its novelty and advantages. The gated mechanism enables the model to capture long-term dependencies, retain relevant context, handle variable length sequences, mitigate error propagation, and adapt to contextual variations. The pipeline involves preprocessing the handwritten text images, extracting features, modeling the sequential dependencies using the gated mechanism, and decoding the output into readable text. The training process utilizes annotated datasets and optimization techniques to minimize transcription discrepancies.

A novel ensemble ADR approach (EADR) is proposed in this study to detect ADRs from Twitter data. The EADR method encompasses several steps, including Twitter data preprocessing, addressing data imbalance through a combination of oversampling and under sampling methods, feature extraction, and the utilization of a Stacking Model, a classification system based on ensemble learning.

These messages require natural language processing and, while word embedding models, such as word2vec, have the potential to extract meaningful signals from text, they are not readily applicable to patient portal messages. This is because embedding models typically require millions of training samples to sufficiently represent semantics, while the volume of patient portal messages associated with a particular clinical phenomenon is often relatively small. We introduce a novel adaptation of the word2vec model, PK-word2vec (where PK stands for prior knowledge), for small-scale messages. PK-word2vec incorporates the most similar terms for medical words (including problems, treatments, and tests) and non-medical words from two pre-trained embedding models as prior knowledge to improve the training process. We applied PK-word2vec in a case study of patient portal messages in the Vanderbilt University Medical Center electric health record system sent by patients diagnosed with breast cancer from December 2004 to November 2017. We evaluated the model through a set of 1000 tasks, each of which compared the relevance of a given word to a group of the five most similar words generated by PK-word2vec and a group of the five most similar words generated by the standard word2vec model. We recruited 200 Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) workers and 7 medical students to perform the tasks. The dataset was composed of 1389 patient records and included 137,554 messages with 10,683 unique words. Prior knowledge was available for 7981 non-medical and 1116 medical words. In over 90% of the tasks, both reviewers indicated PK-word2vec generated more similar words than standard word2vec (p = 0.01).The difference in the evaluation by AMT workers versus medical students was negligible for all comparisons of tasks’ choices between the two groups of reviewers (p=0.774 under a paired t-test).

The outcome of this verification is a continuous credibility score instead of a binary result, an entirely novel contribution by this work. Moreover, social media metrics (i.e., user context) are exploited by calculating their correlation with the credibility rankings, providing insights on the interest of the end-users in financial posts and their forecasts (i.e., drop or rise).

Among these metabolites, ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are becoming a promising source of therapeutic agents due to their structural diversity and functional versatility. However, their biosynthetic capacity and ecological functions remain largely underexplored. Results: Here, we aim to explore the biosynthetic profile of RiPPs and their potential roles in the interactions between microbes and viruses in the ocean, which encompasses a vast diversity of unique biomes that are rich in interactions and remains chemically underexplored. We first developed TrRiPP to identify RiPPs from ocean metagenomes, a deep learning method that detects RiPP precursors in a hallmark gene-independent manner to overcome the limitations of classic methods in processing highly fragmented metagenomic data. Applying this method to metagenomes from the global ocean microbiome, we uncover a diverse array of previously uncharacterized putative RiPP families with great novelty and diversity. Through correlation analysis based on metatranscriptomic data, we observed a high prevalence of antiphage defense-related and phage-related protein families that were co-expressed with RiPP families. Based on this putative association between RiPPs and phage infection, we constructed an Ocean Virus Database (OVD) and established a RiPP-involving host-phage interaction network through host prediction and co-expression analysis, revealing complex connectivities linking RiPP-encoding prokaryotes, RiPP families, viral protein families, and phages. These findings highlight the potential of RiPP families involved in prokaryote-phage interactions and coevolution, providing insights into their ecological functions in the ocean microbiome. Conclusions: This study provides a systematic investigation of the biosynthetic potential of RiPPs from the ocean microbiome at a global scale, shedding light on the essential insights into the ecological functions of RiPPs in prokaryote-phage interactions through the integration of deep learning approaches, metatranscriptomic data, and host-phage connectivity.

Thus, the study of WBC classification is quite significant for medical diagnosis. Due to the widespread use of deep learning in medical image analysis in recent years, it has also been used in WBC classification. Moreover, the ConvMixer and Swin transformer models, recently introduced, have garnered significant success by attaining efficient long contextual characteristics.

Considering the limitations of the high false positive rate and reliance on radiologists’ experience in computed tomography (CT)–based diagnosis, a multi-modal early LC screening model that combines radiology with other non-invasive, rapid detection methods is warranted. A high-resolution, multi-modal, and low-differentiation LC screening strategy named ensemble text and breath analysis (ETBA) is proposed that ensembles radiology report text analysis and breath analysis. In total, 231 samples (140 LC patients and 91 benign lesions [BL] patients) were screened using proton transfer reaction–time of flight–mass spectrometry and CT screening. Participants were randomly assigned to a training set and a validation set (4:1) with stratification. The report section of the radiology reports was used to train a text analysis (TA) model with a natural language processing algorithm. Twenty-two volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the exhaled breath and the prediction results of the TA model were used as predictors to develop the ETBA model using an extreme gradient boosting algorithm. A breath analysis model was developed based on the 22 VOCs. The BA and TA models were compared with the ETBA model. The ETBA model achieved a sensitivity of 94.3%, a specificity of 77.3%, and an accuracy of 87.7% with the validation set. The radiologist diagnosis performance with the validation set had a sensitivity of 74.3%, a specificity of 59.1%, and an accuracy of 68.1%. High sensitivity and specificity were obtained by the ETBA model compared with radiologist diagnosis. The ETBA model has the potential to provide sensitivity and specificity in CT screening of LC. This approach is rapid, non-invasive, multi-dimensional, and accurate for LC and BL diagnosis. © The Author(s) 2024.",Benign lesion; Breath analysis; ensemble model; Lung cancer; Natural language processing,Nature Research,"A multi-modal early LC screening model that combines radiology with other non-invasive, rapid detection methods is warranted.

This study examines whether tFUS neuromodulation can improve BCI outcomes, and explores the underlying mechanism of action using high-density electroencephalography (EEG) source imaging (ESI). As a result, V5-targeted tFUS significantly reduced the error in a BCI speller task. Source analyses revealed a significantly increase in theta and alpha activities in the tFUS condition at both V5 and downstream in the dorsal visual processing pathway.

However, the circular consensus sequencing (CCS) produces shorter reads. Thus, it is effective to manage the error rate of long reads algorithmically with the help of the homologous high-precision and low-cost short reads from the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology. Methods: In this work, a hybrid error correction method (NmTHC) based on a generative neural machine translation model is proposed to automatically capture discrepancies within the aligned regions of long reads and short reads, as well as the contextual relationships within the long reads themselves for error correction. Akin to natural language sequences, the long read can be regarded as a special “genetic language” and be processed with the idea of generative neural networks. The algorithm builds a sequence-to-sequence(seq2seq) framework with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) as the core layer. The before and post-corrected long reads are regarded as the sentences in the source and target language of translation, and the alignment information of long reads with short reads is used to create the special corpus for training. The well-trained model can be used to predict the corrected long read. Results: NmTHC outperforms the latest mainstream hybrid error correction methods on real-world datasets from two mainstream platforms, including PacBio and Nanopore. Our experimental evaluation results demonstrate that NmTHC can align more bases with the reference genome without any segmenting in the six benchmark datasets, proving that it enhances alignment identity without sacrificing any length advantages of long reads. Conclusion: Consequently, NmTHC reasonably adopts the generative Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model to transform hybrid error correction tasks into machine translation problems and provides a novel perspective for solving long-read error correction problems with the ideas of Natural Language Processing (NLP). More remarkably, the proposed methodology is sequencing-technology-independent and can produce more precise reads. © The Author(s) 2024.",Hybrid error correction; Long read; Natural language processing; Neural machine translation,BioMed Central Ltd,The long read can be regarded as a special ‘genetic language’ and be processed with the idea of generative neural networks.

These models consist of large amounts of parameters that are tuned using vast amounts of training data. These factors cause the models to memorize parts of their training data, making them vulnerable to various privacy attacks. This is cause for concern, especially when these models are applied in the clinical domain, where data are very sensitive. Training data pseudonymization is a privacy-preserving technique that aims to mitigate these problems. This technique automatically identifies and replaces sensitive entities with realistic but non-sensitive surrogates. Pseudonymization has yielded promising results in previous studies. However, no previous study has applied pseudonymization to both the pre-training data of PLMs and the fine-tuning data used to solve clinical NLP tasks. This study evaluates the effects on the predictive performance of end-to-end pseudonymization of Swedish clinical BERT models fine-tuned for five clinical NLP tasks. A large number of statistical tests are performed, revealing minimal harm to performance when using pseudonymized fine-tuning data. The results also find no deterioration from end-to-end pseudonymization of pre-training and fine-tuning data.

The latter constraint, though, is becoming less of a limiting factor through the production of text-based indicators. In this paper we assemble a dataset of such monthly measures of what we call “institutional instability”, for three representative emerging market economies: Brazil, Colombia and Mexico. We then forecast quarterly GDP by adding these new variables to a standard macro-forecasting model using different methods.

Next, we examined 1769 CT-related articles from four fact-checking websites, focusing on their core content, and used a technique called Keyphrase Extraction to label the documents. This process yielded 769 identified conspiracies, each assigned a label and a family name. The second goal of this project was to detect whether an article is a conspiracy theory, so we built a binary classifier with our labeled dataset. This model uses a transformer-based machine learning technique and is pre-trained on a large corpus called RoBERTa, resulting in an F1 score of 87%. This model helps to identify potential conspiracy theories in new articles. We used a combination of clustering (HDBSCAN) and a dimension reduction technique (UMAP) to assign a label from the tree to these new articles detected as conspiracy theories. We then labeled these groups accordingly to help us match them to the tree. These can lead us to detect new conspiracy theories and expand the tree using computational methods.

It is essential to obtain information on smoking habits to advance research and implement preventive measures such as screening of high-risk individuals. In most countries, including Denmark, smoking habits are not systematically recorded and at best documented within unstructured free-text segments of electronic health records (EHRs). This would require researchers and clinicians to manually navigate through extensive amounts of unstructured data, which is one of the main reasons that smoking habits are rarely integrated into larger studies. Our aim is to develop machine learning models to classify patients’ smoking status from their EHRs. Methods: This study proposes an efficient natural language processing (NLP) pipeline capable of classifying patients’ smoking status and providing explanations for the decisions. The proposed NLP pipeline comprises four distinct components, which are; (1) considering preprocessing techniques to address abbreviations, punctuation, and other textual irregularities, (2) four cutting-edge feature extraction techniques, i.e. Embedding, BERT, Word2Vec, and Count Vectorizer, employed to extract the optimal features, (3) utilization of a Stacking-based Ensemble (SE) model and a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network (CNN-LSTM) for the identification of smoking status, and (4) application of a local interpretable model-agnostic explanation to explain the decisions rendered by the detection models. The EHRs of 23,132 patients with suspected lung cancer were collected from the Region of Southern Denmark during the period 1/1/2009-31/12/2018. A medical professional annotated the data into ‘Smoker’ and ‘Non-Smoker’ with further classifications as ‘Active-Smoker’, ‘Former-Smoker’, and ‘Never-Smoker’. Subsequently, the annotated dataset was used for the development of binary and multiclass classification models. An extensive comparison was conducted of the detection performance across various model architectures. Results: The results of experimental validation confirm the consistency among the models. However, for binary classification, BERT method with CNN-LSTM architecture outperformed other models by achieving precision, recall, and F1-scores between 97% and 99% for both Never-Smokers and Active-Smokers. In multiclass classification, the Embedding technique with CNN-LSTM architecture yielded the most favorable results in class-specific evaluations, with equal performance measures of 97% for Never-Smoker and measures in the range of 86 to 89% for Active-Smoker and 91–92% for Never-Smoker. Conclusion: Our proposed NLP pipeline achieved a high level of classification performance. In addition, we presented the explanation of the decision made by the best performing detection model. Future work will expand the model’s capabilities to analyze longer notes and a broader range of categories to maximize its utility in further research and screening applications. © The Author(s) 2024.",CNN; Deep learning; Electronic health record; Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI); LSTM; Natural language processing; Smoking status; Stacking-based ensemble; Text classification,BioMed Central Ltd,"Smoking is a critical risk factor responsible for over eight million annual deaths worldwide.

This study applies NLP to a deliberately selected literature review problem, the trend of using NLP in medical research, to demonstrate the performance of this automated abstract review model. Methods: Scanning PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases, we identified 22,294 with a final selection of 12,817 English abstracts published between 2000 and 2021. We invented a manual classification of medical fields, three variables, i.e., the context of use (COU), text source (TS), and primary research field (PRF). A training dataset was developed after reviewing 485 abstracts. We used a language model called Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers to classify the abstracts. To evaluate the performance of the trained models, we report a micro f1-score and accuracy. Results: The trained models’ micro f1-score for classifying abstracts, into three variables were 77.35% for COU, 76.24% for TS, and 85.64% for PRF. The average annual growth rate (AAGR) of the publications was 20.99% between 2000 and 2020 (72.01 articles (95% CI: 56.80–78.30) yearly increase), with 81.76% of the abstracts published between 2010 and 2020.

We assess the method in three German eye hospitals. Our algorithm is based on the nearest-neighbor method as well as on a large thesaurus for ICD-10 codes. This thesaurus was embedded into a Word2Vec space created from anonymized physicians’ reports of the first hospital. For evaluation, each of the three hospitals sent all diagnoses taken from 100 letters. The inferred ICD-10 codes were evaluated for correctness by the senders. A total of 3332 natural language terms had been sent in (812 hospital one, 1473 hospital two, 1047 hospital three). A total of 526 non-diagnoses were excluded upfront. 2806 ICD-10 codes were inferred (771 hospital one, 1226 hospital two, 809 hospital three).

Our simple method is capable of inferring ICD-10 codes for German natural language diagnoses, especially when the embedding space has been built with physicians’ letters from the same hospital.

While positive interactions within diverse communities can considerably enhance confidence, it is critical to recognize that negative comments can hurt people’s reputations and well-being. Currently, individuals tend to express their thoughts in their native languages on these platforms, which is quite challenging due to potential syntactic ambiguity in these languages. Most of the research has been conducted for resource-aware languages like English. However, low-resource languages such as Urdu, Arabic, and Hindi present challenges due to limited linguistic resources, making information extraction labor-intensive. This study concentrates on code-mixed languages, including three types of text: English, Roman Urdu, and their combination. This study introduces robust transformer-based algorithms to enhance sentiment prediction in code-mixed text, which is a combination of Roman Urdu and English in the same context. Unlike conventional deep learning-based models, transformers are adept at handling syntactic ambiguity, facilitating the interpretation of semantics across various languages. We used state-of-the-art transformer-based models like Electra, code-mixed BERT (cm-BERT), and Multilingual Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers (mBART) to address sentiment prediction challenges in code-mixed tweets. Furthermore, results reveal that mBART outperformed the Electra and cm-BERT models for sentiment prediction in code-mixed text with an overall F1-score of 0.73.

Twenty questions covering four topics (general, sensory system, motor system, and integrative) and two cognitive levels (lower-order and higher-order) were posed to the LLMs. Physiologists scored the essay-style answers on a scale of 0–5 points. Statistical analysis compared the scores across different levels such as model, language, topic, and cognitive levels. Performing qualitative analysis identified reasoning gaps. In general, the models demonstrated good performance (mean score = 3.87/5), with no significant difference between language or cognitive levels.

However, no method of low-pass whole genome sequencing (LP-WGS) has been reported for the detection of AOH in a low-pass setting of less than onefold. We developed a method, termed CNVseq-AOH, for predicting the absence of heterozygosity using LP-WGS with ultra-low sequencing data, which overcomes the sparse nature of typical LP-WGS data by combing population-based haplotype information, adjustable sliding windows, and recurrent neural network (RNN). We tested the feasibility of CNVseq-AOH for the detection of AOH in 409 cases (11 AOH regions for model training and 863 AOH regions for validation) from the 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP). AOH detection using CNVseq-AOH was also performed on 6 clinical cases with previously ascertained AOHs by whole exome sequencing (WES). Results: Using SNP-based microarray results as reference (AOHs detected by CNVseq-AOH with at least a 50% overlap with the AOHs detected by chromosomal microarray analysis), 409 samples (863 AOH regions) in the 1KGP were used for concordant analysis. For 784 AOHs on autosomes and 79 AOHs on the X chromosome, CNVseq-AOH can predict AOHs with a concordant rate of 96.23% and 59.49% respectively based on the analysis of 0.1-fold LP-WGS data, which is far lower than the current standard in the field. Using 0.1-fold LP-WGS data, CNVseq-AOH revealed 5 additional AOHs (larger than 10 Mb in size) in the 409 samples. We further analyzed AOHs larger than 10 Mb, which is recommended for reporting the possibility of UPD. For the 291 AOH regions larger than 10 Mb, CNVseq-AOH can predict AOHs with a concordant rate of 99.66% with only 0.1-fold LP-WGS data. In the 6 clinical cases, CNVseq-AOH revealed all 15 known AOH regions. Conclusions: Here we reported a method for analyzing LP-WGS data to accurately identify regions of AOH, which possesses great potential to improve genetic testing of AOH. © The Author(s) 2024.",AOH; LP-WGS; RNN,BioMed Central Ltd,"The absence of heterozygosity (AOH) is a kind of genomic change characterized by a long contiguous region of homozygous alleles in a chromosome.

In the last few decades, significant efforts have been dedicated to incident control measures to reduce the rate of safety incidents. Despite all these efforts, the rate of decline in serious injuries and fatalities (SIFs) has been considerably lower than the rate of decline for non-critical incidents. This observation has led to a change of risk reduction paradigm for safety incidents. Under the new paradigm, more focus has been allocated to reducing the rate of critical/SIF incidents, as opposed to reducing the count of all incidents. One of the challenges in reducing the number of SIF incidents is the proper identification of the risk prior to materialization. One of the reasons for risk identification being a challenge is that companies usually only focus on incidents where SIF did occur reactively, and incidents that did not cause SIF but had the potential to do so go unnoticed. Identifying these potentially significant incidents, referred to as potential serious injuries and fatalities (PSIF), would enable companies to work on identifying critical risk and taking steps to prevent them preemptively. However, flagging PSIF incidents requires all incident reports to be analyzed individually by experts and hence significant investment, which is often not affordable, especially for small and medium sized companies. This study is aimed at addressing this problem through machine learning powered automation. We propose a novel approach based on binary classification for the identification of such incidents involving PSIF (potential serious injuries and fatalities). This is the first work towards automatic risk identification from incident reports. Our approach combines a pre-trained transformer model with XGBoost. We utilize advanced natural language processing techniques to encode an incident record comprising heterogeneous fields into a vector representation fed to XGBoost for classification. Moreover, given the scarcity of manually labeled incident records available for training, we leverage weak labeling to augment the label coverage of the training data. We utilize the F2 metric for hyperparameter tuning using Tree-structured Parzen Estimator to prioritize the detection of PSIF records over the avoidance of non-PSIF records being mis-classified as PSIF. The proposed methods outperform several baselines from other studies on a significantly large test dataset. © The Author(s) 2024.",Natural language processing; Potential serious injuries and fatalities; Risk assessment; Risk identification,Nature Research,"Safety incidents have always been a crucial risk in work spaces, especially industrial sites.

However, a main issue of these approaches is the lack of transparency and interpretability of the achieved results, making it hard to employ such methods for educational purposes. It is therefore necessary to develop new frameworks to enhance explainability in these solutions. Results: In this paper, we present a novel full pipeline to generate automatically natural language explanations for medical diagnoses. The proposed solution starts from a clinical case description associated with a list of correct and incorrect diagnoses and, through the extraction of the relevant symptoms and findings, enriches the information contained in the description with verified medical knowledge from an ontology. Finally, the system returns a pattern-based explanation in natural language which elucidates why the correct (incorrect) diagnosis is the correct (incorrect) one. The main contribution of the paper is twofold: first, we propose two novel linguistic resources for the medical domain (i.e, a dataset of 314 clinical cases annotated with the medical entities from UMLS, and a database of biological boundaries for common findings), and second, a full Information Extraction pipeline to extract symptoms and findings from the clinical cases and match them with the terms in a medical ontology and to the biological boundaries. An extensive evaluation of the proposed approach shows the our method outperforms comparable approaches.

PS-GO, a parametric protein search engine, has been specifically designed and developed to maximize the utilization of the rapidly growing volume of protein-related data. This innovative tool addresses the critical need for effective retrieval, comparison, and deep understanding of protein structures. By integrating computational biology, bioinformatics, and data science, PS-GO is capable of managing large-scale data and accurately predicting and comparing protein structures and functions. The engine is built upon the concept of parametric protein design, a computer-aided method that adjusts and optimizes protein structures and sequences to achieve desired biological functions and structural stability. PS-GO utilizes key parameters such as amino acid sequence, side chain angle, and solvent accessibility, which have a significant influence on protein structure and function. Additionally, PS-GO leverages computable parameters, derived computationally, which are crucial for understanding and predicting protein behavior. The development of PS-GO underscores the potential of parametric protein design in a variety of applications, including enhancing enzyme activity, improving antibody affinity, and designing novel functional proteins.

This research departs from conventional approaches by concentrating not only on the characteristics of shared content but also on user interactions and the resultant topologies of content propagation trees. In our study, we have introduced a deep learning model based on Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNN) and enhanced with multi-head attention mechanisms. This model leverages a wide range of psycholinguistic attributes extracted from users’ posts, including sentiment, emotional content, linguistic features, personality traits, readability, and communication style. We further enrich these attributes with BERT embeddings to improve textual representation. Our research framework involves creating two distinct graph networks: the user interaction graph and the semantic propagation graph. These graphical representations are essential for visualizing dynamic interactions and patterns of information dissemination among users. For each user, we generate a set of carefully crafted features that capture their unique characteristics and behaviors. These user-specific features are then integrated into the User Interaction Graph, enabling a more nuanced understanding and representation of user interactions within our proposed model.

In China, the tense doctor-patient ratio poses numerous challenges for the early diagnosis and treatment of ocular fundus diseases. To reduce the high risk of missed or misdiagnosed cases, avoid irreversible visual impairment for patients, and ensure good visual prognosis for patients with ocular fundus diseases, it is particularly important to enhance the growth and diagnostic capabilities of junior doctors. This study aims to leverage the value of electronic medical record data to developing a diagnostic intelligent decision support platform. This platform aims to assist junior doctors in diagnosing ocular fundus diseases quickly and accurately, expedite their professional growth, and prevent delays in patient treatment. An empirical evaluation will assess the platform’s effectiveness in enhancing doctors’ diagnostic efficiency and accuracy. Methods: In this study, eight Chinese Named Entity Recognition (NER) models were compared, and the SoftLexicon-Glove-Word2vec model, achieving a high F1 score of 93.02%, was selected as the optimal recognition tool. This model was then used to extract key information from electronic medical records (EMRs) and generate feature variables based on diagnostic rule templates. Subsequently, an XGBoost algorithm was employed to construct an intelligent decision support platform for diagnosing ocular fundus diseases. The effectiveness of the platform in improving diagnostic efficiency and accuracy was evaluated through a controlled experiment comparing experienced and junior doctors. Results: The use of the diagnostic intelligent decision support platform resulted in significant improvements in both diagnostic efficiency and accuracy for both experienced and junior doctors (P < 0.05). Notably, the gap in diagnostic speed and precision between junior doctors and experienced doctors narrowed considerably when the platform was used. Although the platform also provided some benefits to experienced doctors, the improvement was less pronounced compared to junior doctors.

A manually annotated dataset of 10 000 referrals has been used to develop the pipeline and another manually annotated dataset of 10 000 referrals has been used to test its performance. Subsequently, the pipeline has been used to analyze all 12 million referrals prescribed in 2021 and performed by May 2022 in the Lombardy Region. Results: The NLP-based pipeline exhibited high precision (0.999) and recall (0.973) in identifying waiting time information from referrals’ texts, with high accuracy in normalization (0.948-0.998).

Here, we aim to present our approach for analyzing multimodal data using unsupervised and supervised sparse linear methods in a COVID-19 patient cohort. This prospective cohort study of 149 adult patients was conducted in a tertiary care academic center. First, we used sparse canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to identify and quantify relationships across different data modalities, including viral genome sequencing, imaging, clinical data, and laboratory results. Then, we used cooperative learning to predict the clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients: Intensive care unit admission. We show that serum biomarkers representing severe disease and acute phase response correlate with original and wavelet radiomics features in the LLL frequency channel (cor(Xu1, Zv1) = 0.596, p value < 0.001). Among radiomics features, histogram-based first-order features reporting the skewness, kurtosis, and uniformity have the lowest negative, whereas entropy-related features have the highest positive coefficients. Moreover, unsupervised analysis of clinical data and laboratory results gives insights into distinct clinical phenotypes. Leveraging the availability of global viral genome databases, we demonstrate that the Word2Vec natural language processing model can be used for viral genome encoding. It not only separates major SARS-CoV-2 variants but also allows the preservation of phylogenetic relationships among them. Our quadruple model using Word2Vec encoding achieves better prediction results in the supervised task. The model yields area under the curve (AUC) and accuracy values of 0.87 and 0.77, respectively. Our study illustrates that sparse CCA analysis and cooperative learning are powerful techniques for handling high-dimensional, multimodal data to investigate multivariate associations in unsupervised and supervised tasks. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Nature Research,We present our approach for analyzing multimodal data using unsupervised and supervised sparse linear methods in a COVID-19 patient cohort.

Is such negativity a stable feature of society and, if so, what mechanisms maintain stability both within and across group targets? Answering these theoretically and practically important questions requires data on dozens of group stereotypes examined simultaneously over historical and societal scales, which is only possible through recent advances in Natural Language Processing. Across two studies, we use word embeddings from millions of English-language books over 100 years (1900–2000) and extract stereotypes for 58 stigmatized groups. Study 1 examines aggregate, societal-level trends in stereotype negativity by averaging across these groups. Results reveal striking persistence in aggregate negativity (no meaningful slope), suggesting that society maintains a stable level of negative stereotypes. Study 2 introduces and tests a new framework identifying potential mechanisms upholding stereotype negativity over time. We find evidence of two key sources of this aggregate persistence: within-group “reproducibility” (e.g., stereotype negativity can be maintained by using different traits with the same underlying meaning) and across-group “replacement” (e.g., negativity from one group is transferred to other related groups). These findings provide novel historical evidence of mechanisms upholding stigmatization in society and raise new questions regarding the possibility of future stigma change. © The Author(s) 2024.",Historical change; Stereotypes; Stigma; Text analysis; Word embeddings,Nature Research,"Today, many social groups face negative stereotypes.

Language architectures have emerged as a hotbed of innovation and creativity in natural language processing over the last decade, and have since gained prominence in modeling proteins and chemical processes, elucidating structural relationships from textual/sequential data. Surprisingly, some of these relationships refer to three-dimensional structural features, raising important questions on the dimensionality of the information encoded within sequential data. Here, we demonstrate that the unsupervised use of a language model architecture to a language representation of bio-catalyzed chemical reactions can capture the signal at the base of the substrate-binding site atomic interactions. This allows us to identify the three-dimensional binding site position in unknown protein sequences. The language representation comprises a reaction-simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) for substrate and products, and amino acid sequence information for the enzyme. This approach can recover, with no supervision, 52.13% of the binding site when considering co-crystallized substrate-enzyme structures as ground truth, vastly outperforming other attention-based models. © 2024 The Author(s)",,Elsevier B.V.,Unsupervised use of a language model architecture to a language representation of bio-catalyzed chemical reactions can capture the signal at the base of the substrate-binding site atomic interactions.
